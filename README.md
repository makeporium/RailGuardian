# 🚆 RailGuardian  Smart Hygiene & Maintenance System for Indian Railways

**RailGuardian** is a lightweight, AI-assisted platform designed to modernize how hygiene, maintenance, and complaint management is handled across India's train coaches without needing complex infrastructure or passenger apps.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Indian trains, despite being used by millions daily, suffer from inconsistent hygiene standards, inefficient staff monitoring, and delayed responses to passenger complaints. Existing systems are outdated, rely on manual logs, and often lack real-time accountability especially in remote regions with poor network access.

---

## 💡 What RailGuardian Does

RailGuardian digitizes the hygiene & safety workflow with an offline-first system using:

- **QR-based checkpoints** inside train coaches and toilets for cleaning staff
- **Photo capture & AI verification** to confirm real cleaning activity
- **Offline storage** and background syncing for low-network zones
- **Automatic complaint assignment** based on QR scans by passengers
- **Smart admin dashboard** for station/zonal managers with hygiene logs and performance reports

---

## 🔧 Key Features

### 🧹 For Staff (Android App)
- Scan QR/NFC tags inside coaches/toilets to mark cleaning
- Upload real time cleaning proof photo
- Lightweight AI model (on-device) checks for cleanliness
- Works offline with delayed sync

### 🤖 For AI Engine
- TensorFlow Lite-based model detects "clean" vs "unclean" toilet photo
- Alerts raised for fake uploads or poor-quality photos

### 🧾 For Passengers
- Scan QR code inside any coach to report issues (form-based)
- No need to download app  mobile browser interface
- Complaints are auto-assigned based on coach QR

### 📊 For Admins
- View coach-wise cleaning history
- Track staff scans and performance
- Analyze complaint heatmaps
- Export audit-ready reports
